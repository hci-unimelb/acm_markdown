# ACM Markdown template

This is a markdown template that can be used in R studio. The template allows you to write papers for ACM journals and conferences, and it uses the latest styles provided by ACM (as of September 2018). You can open the file "mypaper_acm.Rmd" in RStudio, press the "Knit" button, and hopefully a pdf file will be generated.

You need to have latex installed on your computer, and also need to have a number of packages installed RStudio.

The file mypaper_acm.Rmd contains self-explanatory code. More instructions will follow here soon.
